# Bootstrap basic webpage

A head section that includes a link to the Bootstrap CSS file.
A body section that includes a container element with a class of "container" or "container-fluid" to set the width of the content.
Within the container, rows and columns can be added to create a grid layout. Bootstrap uses a 12-column grid system, so rows are divided into 12 equal-width columns.
To create a layout, use classes such as "row" and "col-*" (where * is a number between 1 and 12) to define the number of columns in a row.
Elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and buttons can be added within the columns to create the content of the webpage.
The webpage may also include a navigation bar, which can be created using the Bootstrap navbar component.
Additional Bootstrap components such as forms, modals, and cards can be added to enhance the functionality and design of the webpage.
